# CrowdStrike (CRWD) — One-Page Memo (2025-09-16)

_Educational only; not investment advice._

## Thesis (1–2 sentences)
Falcon platform compounding ARR via multi-module adoption; if execution and reliability hold, FY26 targets are achievable despite competition.

## Must-be-true (3)
- Net-new ARR averages ≥ $200M/quarter through FY26
- Net revenue and units within guided range; operating leverage intact
- Multi-module attach rises; churn contained

## Catalysts (3–12 mo)
- Next quarter print vs. guide (net-new ARR, large-deal mix)
- New module adoption & AI/LogScale traction
- Public-sector/governed wins

## Risks / Kill-switch
- Quality/reliability incidents (major outage)
- Bundled competition (MSFT Defender, APNW discounting)
- Budget pressure elongates cycles; NRR slips

**Kill-switch:** exit if a major outage recurs _or_ net-new ARR + $150M guide cut below threshold without clear transient cause.

## Snapshot (inputs)
- Price: **$444.98**
- 3M momentum: **-7.2%**
- 12M momentum: **73.1%**
- Drawdown from 52w high: **-13.4%**

## TRP-1 Score (0–10)
**Score:** **7 / 10** (execution + mix staying favorable; competitive pressure = risk).

## Event study vs SPY (T-1..T+3) — optional
| Day | CRWD | SPY  | Abnormal |
|----:|-----:|-----:|---------:|
| T-1 |  1.99% |  0.53% |  **1.46%** |
| T0  |  0.05% | -0.14% |  **0.18%** |
| T+1 |   —   |   —   |    —     |
| T+2 |   —   |   —   |    —     |
| T+3 |   —   |   —   |    —     |

## Decision & sizing
