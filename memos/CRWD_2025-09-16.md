# CRWD — One-Page Memo (2025-09-16)
_Educational only; not investment advice._

**Thesis (1 sentence):** Falcon platform compounding ARR via multi-module adoption; if execution and reliability hold, FY26 targets are achievable despite competition.

## Must-be-true (3)
- Net-new ARR averages ≥ $200M/quarter through FY26
- FY26 revenue lands within guided range; operating leverage intact
- Multi-module attach rises; churn contained

## Catalysts (3–12 mo)
- Next quarter print vs. guide (net-new ARR, large-deal mix)
- New module adoption & AI/LogScale traction
- Public-sector/regulated wins

## Risks / Kill-switch
- Quality/reliability incidents (major outage)
- Bundled competition (MSFT Defender, PANW discounting)
- Budget pressure elongates cycles; NRR slips

## Event study (optional)
_Add later by running:_ `python cli/evaluate_stock.py CRWD 2025-08-28` _and paste the table._

## Decision & sizing
- (Initiate/Watchlist/Avoid). Exit if net-new ARR < $150M **or** guide cut below threshold without clear transitory cause.
