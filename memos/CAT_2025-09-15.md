# CAT — One-Page Memo (Caterpillar)
*Date:* 2025-09-15  
*Author:* Blake Sinclair • *Educational only; not investment advice.*

## Thesis (≤3 sentences)
Caterpillar is the global leader in heavy equipment with pricing power, a large backlog, and exposure to U.S. infrastructure and mining capex. With margins supported by mix and services, CAT can compound through the cycle while returning cash via buybacks/dividends. Near-term momentum and near-ATH price action signal constructive positioning into the next few quarters.

## Must-be-true (3)
- Backlog + pricing continue to offset input/currency pressure.
- North America non-residential/infrastructure spend remains resilient; mining capex steady.
- Services/parts mix supports margins through softer volumes if cycle cools.

## Snapshot (inputs)
- **Price:** $435.94  
- **3M momentum:** 22.54%  
- **12M momentum:** 32.19%  
- **Drawdown from 52w high:** -0.47%
