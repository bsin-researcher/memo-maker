# AMZN — One-Page Memo  
*Date:* 2025-09-18  
*Educational only; not investment advice.*

## Thesis (1–2 sentences)
Amazon’s core flywheel—retail → Prime → ads—plus AWS gives it multiple monetization layers and operating leverage. Near-term direction is uncertain, but over a 12–24-month window, continued ad/AWS growth and efficiency gains could compound shareholder value.

## Must-be-true (3)
- **Ad + retail flywheel holds:** engagement and ad load keep rising without hurting shopper experience.  
- **AWS stabilizes then re-accelerates:** AI/GenAI workloads offset optimizations; margins remain resilient.  
- **Cost discipline persists:** logistics & infra efficiency gains aren’t given back via price or capex bloat.

## Snapshot (inputs)
- **Price:** $231.43  
- **3M momentum:** 9.11%  
- **12M momentum:** 25.42%  
- **Drawdown from 52w high:** −4.49%

## Event study — AMZN vs SPY (around 2025-09-15)
| Day |  Stock |   SPY  | Abnormal |
|:---:|------:|------:|--------:|
| T-1 |  1.44% |  0.53% |   0.91% |
|  T0 |  1.13% | −0.14% |   1.27% |
| T+1 | −1.04% | −0.12% |  −0.91% |
| T+2 | −0.17% |  0.47% |  −0.64% |
| T+3 |    —   |    —   |     —   |

## Catalysts (3–12 mo)
- Next earnings (Q3) — AWS growth/margin trajectory; ads run-rate.  
- Holiday/Q4 — Prime events + shipping efficiency vs. prior year.  
- Product/AI updates — ad tools, buyer/seller features, AWS GenAI services.

## Risks / kill-switch
- **Regulatory/antitrust** actions that restrict marketplace tying or ad targeting.  
- **Supply-chain/logistics shocks** that reverse fulfillment cost gains.  
- **Security incidents** materially impacting trust or cloud workloads.

**Kill-switch:** de-risk if two of three occur: (i) AWS growth < industry for 2 quarters, (ii) ad growth decelerates sharply without mix explanation, (iii) company guides to meaningfully higher capex with no ROI plan.
