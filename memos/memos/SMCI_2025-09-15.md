Thesis (1–2 sentences)

Super Micro Computer is a key partner for major tech companies building AI infrastructure, and it excels at quickly building and shipping high-performance servers using the latest technology. As the demand for AI processing power continues to grow, SMCI's speed and specialization should allow it to grow faster than its competitors.

Must-be-true (3)

Companies will continue to spend heavily on new AI servers and data centers.

SMCI will maintain its close relationships with chip makers like NVIDIA and AMD, getting access to new chips early.

Competitors like Dell and HP will not be able to match SMCI's speed and customization options for AI-specific hardware.

Catalysts (3–12 months)

The release of next-generation AI chips (e.g., NVIDIA’s “Blackwell” successors), which would require companies to buy new servers from SMCI.

Announcements of new large customers or expanded orders from existing major customers.

Another very strong earnings report showing sales growing faster than analysts expect.

Risks / Kill-switch

Risk 1: A slowdown in the economy could cause companies to cut back on their spending for new AI projects.

Risk 2: Any disruptions in the supply of critical parts, especially high-end chips, could prevent SMCI from building and selling its servers.

Kill-switch: The thesis is invalidated if a major competitor starts offering servers that are just as fast and customizable as SMCI’s, but at a much lower price, and SMCI begins to lose major customers.
