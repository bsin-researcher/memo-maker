# Home Depot (HD) — One-Page Memo (2025-09-16)

_Educational only; not investment advice._

## Thesis (1–2 sentences)
HD’s edge = pro DIY mix + supply chain + in-store productivity; if DIY demand stabilizes while pro stays resilient, FY guide can hold and comps improve.

## Must-be-true (3)
- Pro growth (LTM > DIY) + stable ticket
- Cost/flow execution keeps service levels high
- Housing turnover not deteriorating further

## Catalysts (3–12 mo)
- Next two quarters vs. guide (mix, big-ticket, services)
- Merch/ops refresh & fulfillment throughput
- Rate path + housing activity trend

## Risks / Kill-switch
- Big-ticket rollover; DIY weakness persists
- Deflation on core categories compresses gross margin
- Housing turnover stalls

**Kill-switch:** exit if guide is cut with pro weakness _and_ DIY doesn’t offset.

## Snapshot (inputs)
- Price: **$421.45**
- 3M momentum: **19.9%**
- 12M momentum: **15.2%**
- Drawdown from 52w high: **-0.5%**

## TRP-1 Score (0–10)
**Score:** **6 / 10** (steady operator; macro sensitivity = main risk).

## Event study vs SPY (T-1..T+3) — optional
| Day |  HD   |  SPY  | Abnormal |
|----:|------:|------:|---------:|
| T-1 |  0.00% |  0.53% | **-0.53%** |
| T0  | -0.30% | -0.14% | **-0.16%** |
| T+1 |   —    |   —    |    —     |
| T+2 |   —    |   —    |    —     |
| T+3 |   —    |   —    |    —     |

## Decision & sizing
**Watch (no position).** Prefer clarity on mix and comps trajectory.
