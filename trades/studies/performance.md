# Personal Performance & Decision Log

This page summarizes my decisions and results vs. SPY.  
_Updated manually until I automate it._

## Rules
- Every position must have a memo in `/memos`.
- Record each buy/sell the same day in `/trades/trades.csv`.
- Benchmark: SPY. Timeframes I track: 1M, 3M, since-entry.

## Current decisions

| 2025-09-16 | HD | Watch (no position) | — |

## How I’ll score myself
- **Process**: Did I follow the TRP-1 checklist? (yes/no)
- **Outcome**: Did the position beat SPY over the measured window? (yes/no)
- **Post-mortem**: one paragraph per trade after exit.
