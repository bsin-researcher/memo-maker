Thesis (1–2 sentences)

BlackRock benefits from its unmatched scale in asset management, sticky institutional client base, and tailwinds from long-term adoption of ETFs and passive strategies. Its fee model and operating leverage provide resilient earnings growth, supported by secular trends in retirement investing and global wealth creation.

Must-be-true (3)

ETF and passive inflows continue to grow globally, with BlackRock maintaining dominant market share via iShares.

Institutional mandates remain sticky, providing predictable base fees and recurring revenue.

Rising rates and volatility do not meaningfully disrupt long-term client flows into retirement and wealth products.

Continued ETF inflows, particularly into bond ETFs amid institutional adoption.

Potential margin tailwind from cost discipline and tech-driven efficiency.

Risks / Kill-switch

Regulatory risk: scrutiny on systemic risk, fee transparency, or ESG mandates.

Macro risk: prolonged equity outflows if global recession deepens.

Competitive risk: fee compression from competitors eroding margins.

Execution risk: technology/platform adoption stalls (e.g., Aladdin).
