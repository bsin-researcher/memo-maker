# memo-maker
Open-source student equity-research toolkit: Python CLI + Streamlit bot to generate 1-page memos and T−1→T+3 event studies (educational only).
## Acknowledgments
I designed the evaluation framework and maintain this repo. Code and refactors were co-developed with ChatGPT and open-source libraries (yfinance, pandas, numpy). Educational use only; not investment advice.
