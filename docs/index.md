# Memo Maker
*Open Equity Student Research Lab*  
_For educational purposes only — not investment advice._

[▶ Open the App](https://YOUR-STREAMLIT-APP-URL) · [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/YOUR-VIDEO-ID) · [Method](./method.html) · [Performance](./performance.html) · [Memo Template](./memo_template.html)

## What this accomplishes
- **Generates a one-page memo** for any ticker + event date
- **Snapshot metrics:** Price, 3M/12M momentum, drawdown from 52-week high
- **Event study (T-1..T+3) vs SPY** to frame near-term reaction
- **Beginner-friendly & accessible:** anyone can publish research via a web form
- **Input validation & reproducibility:** results are verifiable from market data (`yfinance`)
